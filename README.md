Histograms and Scatterplots

Hypothesis: As the number of pitchers per game increses the number of strikeouts should also increse due to less pitcher fatigue.


The visualizations were generated using a dataset of yearly pitching totals from 1918 to 2018. I hypothesize that increasing the number of pitchers in baseball season will increase the number of strikeouts thrown in that season. This is based on the idea that increasing the number of pitchers will increase the variety of pitches thrown as well as reduce fatigue within the pitching roster.
The pitcher count had to first be normalized via dividing the number of pitchers that played in each season by the number of games played and then dividing that quotient by the number of teams in each season to estimate the desired statistic, number of pitchers per team for each game. The histogram shows a general increase in pitchers per game between 1920 and 2020.
The scatterplot shows a relation between total hits, walks, home runs, and strikeouts per game in each season. Notice as the number of pitchers increases, so does the number of strikeouts, however the number of hits, walks, and home runs all remain relatively consistent.  Based on the visualizations displayed below, one can conclude that increasing the number of active pitchers does coincide with an increase in strikeouts. However, the number of hits, walks, and runs do not appear to have any direct correlations to the number of pitchers in a season.
